Rapid increase in internet and network technologies has led to considerable increase in number of attacks and intrusions. Detection and prevention of these attacks has become an important part of security. Intrusion detection system is one of the important ways to achieve high security in computer networks and used to thwart different attacks. Intrusion detection systems have curse of dimensionality which tends to increase time complexity and decrease resource utilization. As a result, it is desirable that important features of data must be analyzed by intrusion detection system to reduce dimensionality.
